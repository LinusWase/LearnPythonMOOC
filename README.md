# üêç LearnPythonMOOC - Exercises and Solutions

This repository holds my solutions and notes from the **University of Helsinki's MOOC (Massive Open Online Course)** in Python Programming.

The course provides a thorough introduction to Python, covering everything from basic syntax to more advanced concepts in object-oriented programming.

## üéØ Project Goal (Study & Reference)

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

1.  **Document my progress** and serve as a portfolio for the skills learned throughout the course.
2.  **Store verified solutions** to all programming exercises for future reference.
3.  Act as a **personal learning resource**, not necessarily a production-ready codebase.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The project is organized according to the structure of the course itself, where each folder corresponds to a specific part or module of the curriculum:

Inside each part (e.g., `Part01/`), you will find individual Python files (`.py`) for each completed exercise.

## üíª How to Study the Code

The files are intended to be read and studied. If you wish to run the code locally, you will need **Python 3** installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/LinusWase/LearnPythonMOOC.git](https://github.com/LinusWase/LearnPythonMOOC.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to an exercise folder:**
    ```bash
    cd LearnPythonMOOC/Part01
    ```

3.  **Run the file (optional):**
    ```bash
    python filename.py
    ```
    *(Replace `filename.py` with the specific exercise file you want to test.)*
